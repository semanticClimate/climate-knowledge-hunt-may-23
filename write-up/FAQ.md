## What are the technical requirements to particpate in the hackathon? 
The participants must bring their own laptop that can support modern tools written in Python. 

## Do I need to stay for the whole day?
Yes!

## Do I need computing/programming experience?
No! We will have tested programs online. 

## Why not use ChatGPT?
Because it's not completely trustable and doesn't cover recent material. It doesn't give insights into how it arrives at an answer. Plus, it's not open and the free version is limited!

## What would I do during the hackathon? 
The particpants will be split into smaller teams, each with a theme. The themes may be technical or related to climate topics. Some thought-out ones are: 
- Climate dictionaries with Wikidata links
- Knowledge Graph -- create Markdown files that can be read by Obsidian
- Structure of IPCC Reports -- help us work out which bits to read!
- Interface with Wikimedia

Each group will decide on sub-tasks which could involve coding, brainstorming, making ontologies, etc.
