# Structure of IPCC reports
The IPCC reports are heavily structured and we are including the following:
* SRCCL - 
* SROCCC Special Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate
* SR1.5
* AR6_WGI
* AR6_WGII
* AR6_WGIII

and the recent summary / Synthesis report
* SYR

Each of these can have the following components:
* Chapters 
* SPM
* TS - Technical Summary
* ES
* Annexes

The main body of the documents is sections with paragraphs but there are also the following "floats"
* Figures
* Tables
* Boxes

# Proposed tasks and methodology

The documents above are heavily interlinked and create a semantic network ("knowledge graph"). Our goal is to create this 
graph and add semantics (the relations between these components). We will also add meaning through ontologies ("dictionaries") to explain
the extensive terminology of the IPCC. In many cases we can link this to existing resources such as Wikipedia / Wikidata which has
a large and well-developed link structure and ontology.
When this is built we can ask questions aboout relations and meaning. For example find all paragraphs in the system that relate to "GHG" (greenhouse gas). 

# Delhi Hackathon 2023-05-18/19

This brings together Wikimedians, Climate Scientists, Policy Makers, Educators, and Concerned Citizens to create the first vision of this
knlwedge graph. It can be built in stages, starting with SYR/LongerReport and branching out to the many resources it links to. We'll work in teams
with a balance of experience, specialities, tackling different componenst of the IPCC documents. The graph structure can accommodate different 
approaches and amounts of progress so it's ideal for a hackathon.

We will be using a range of tools and make sure that in each team there is someone who knows how to use them. It will be useful if delegates can 
try them out beforehand. 

It will be useful if delegates can have a look at the SYR/LongerReport beforehand. Our goal is to make this accessible to a wide public. 
Think of questions and outcomes which would be useful on the day.

## what you can expect 
* work in a team to tackle part of the project
* learn-by-doing about climate and document technology
* discuss with others (team and plenary) about the value of IPCC reports and the knowledge graph

## what you can bring
* knowledge of climate science and IPCC processes
* working in teams
* running software
* transforming documents into knolwedge
* summarisinf and outreach
* visualisatiomn 
* an open mind and innovative approach
